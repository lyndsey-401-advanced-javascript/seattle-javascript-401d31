README for Lab03 creation of Asynch Functions used to modify a file 

Here are the parameters of the lab (as I understood them):
Assigment- write code in edit-file.js that modifies a file on your computer
Rqmnts: 
1. use fs  [x]
2. accept file name as parameter [x]
3. read contents of file [x]
4. convert to JS object 
5. alter values
6. re-open and prove values have been altered 

For the purposes of this, I assumed we were meant to be modifying person.json
